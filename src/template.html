		<p>At our restaurant, Odin is a regular, enjoying hearty meals of roasted meats and golden apples. The staff serve him with great reverence, and the ale never runs dry. Every meal he enjoys reminds us that even gods appreciate life’s simple joys.</p>
		<p>Locals often visit, hoping for a chance to see the Allfather and receive his blessing.  It’s a place where both mortals and gods come together in shared abundance.</p>
